# f1-dashboard
F1 is my favorite sport so I thought I would combine my passion for this sport with my interests in data science and analysis! I used the fastf1-api for the data and Im working on this passion project on the side so some of the stuff does need work, any feedback is appreciated!

Future Features:

- Prediction model to predict race wins and optimal pit windows
- Driver point progression through different seasons
- Detailed technical statistical analysis
- Consice web pages with multiple webpages



Note: Some of the data does take a while to load as Im still figuring out how to streamline that process

Forza Ferrari!
